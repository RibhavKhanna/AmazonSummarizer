# AmazonSummarizer

This tool is supposed to do exactly what the name says, "summarizing your Amazon data". Doesn't matter if you want to see your amazon spendings for better planning in future, or if you are a curious soul trying to :O from your "Amazon behaviour", this tool is for YOU.

## OK, but how do I load my Amazon data?

Amazon collects and stores plethora of data for your (& and their ;)) benefit. You can request a copy from them [HERE](https://www.amazon.in/gp/privacycentral/dsar/preview.html). For now this tool would only use order history (expanding soon*).

NOTE: NEVER commit your Amazon data files to repo. It contains sensitive information that you wouldn't want to put out there for everyone to see.

*soon = as soon as I get the data I've requested and can find time to understand relation between those files. XD
